# Contributors

BagIdea Office is built in the open. Huge thanks to everyone who has helped — by
sending a pull request, reporting an issue, or testing on a platform we couldn't.

## Maintainer

- **[@bagidea](https://github.com/bagidea)** — creator & maintainer (BagIdea Innovation Co., Ltd.)

## Community contributors

Thank you for the pull requests that made the office better — especially the
early macOS support, when the project was Windows-only:

- **[@spondanai](https://github.com/spondanai)** — macOS support & installer resilience
  ([#4](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/4)), an early refactor +
  automated tests pass ([#1](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/1)), and the
  macOS occlusion FPS throttle — 30→2 fps when the wallpaper is hidden
  ([#11](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/11)).
- **[@misternay](https://github.com/misternay)** (Ritthikiat Jindajak) — a prolific
  contributor across the stack: the macOS/Linux CLI shell-finder
  ([#9](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/9)), **full macOS support**
  ([#12](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/12)), TTS hardening
  ([#14](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/14)), run-lifecycle safety —
  timeouts, graceful shutdown, cross-platform process-tree kill
  ([#16](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/16)), live chat status +
  inline permission approval ([#18](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/18)),
  routing each agent's brain in meetings/reflection — the 401 fix
  ([#22](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/22)), and stopping phantom
  agent seats after hire→delete ([#25](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/25)).

## Plugin authors

Submitting a plugin to the [Plugins Hub](https://bagidea.github.io/bagidea-office/plugins.html)
means opening a PR that adds your plugin to `web/plugins.json`. When we merge it
(preserving your authorship), you're credited in **three** places:

1. **GitHub Contributors graph** — your catalog PR is a commit authored by you.
2. **The Plugins page** — your plugin card shows `@your-handle` (the `author` field).
3. **This file** — we add you below.

Your plugin's own code lives in your own repo, where you're of course the author.

- **[@misternay](https://github.com/misternay)** — **🧪 Agent Workbench**
  ([repo](https://github.com/misternay/bagidea-office-agent-workbench-plugin),
  [#26](https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/pull/26)) — the **first community plugin**
  in the Hub: test & benchmark agents — run prompts, capture responses, measure token usage,
  and save runs as reusable regression test cases.

## Built with Claude Code

Much of the implementation was pair-built with **Claude** (Anthropic) via Claude Code.
Commits carry a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer to credit that honestly — which is
why **Claude** appears on the Contributors graph.

## For maintainers — merging PRs so credit is preserved

GitHub only lists someone as a contributor when a commit **authored by them** (with a
GitHub-linked email) lands on the default branch. A squash-merge that re-authors the
commit to the maintainer **erases the contributor's credit** (this is why an earlier
merged PR didn't show up).

When merging a community PR, preserve authorship:

- **Preferred — a real merge commit** (keeps every original commit + author):
  ```bash
  gh pr merge <num> --merge
  ```
- **If you squash**, make sure the contributor is still credited — squash keeps the
  PR author as the commit author by default, but verify, and keep any
  `Co-authored-by:` trailers in the squashed message:
  ```bash
  gh pr merge <num> --squash   # then check `git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'`
  ```
- Never hand-cherry-pick a contributor's work into a commit authored by you without a
  `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` trailer.

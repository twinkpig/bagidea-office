# Agents & Skills — Build Your Team

![Chat window with an agent](../img/overlay.png)

## The starting team

A fresh office has 2 people: **you (CEO 👑)** and **Shino** — the Director (your right hand),
already fully configured: a playful young guy who's serious about work, focused mainly on **delegating and
managing the team** (he has few hands-on tools, but excels at directing), with the `office-ops` + `plugin-builder`
+ `project-kickoff` skills, a 🌿 nature aura, and a 🎈 playful young voice. From there you hire more of the team
as work demands — Shino will distribute the work himself based on each person's strengths

Everyone is arranged into an automatic org chart (🗂 → ORG): CEO → Director → tier 2 → tier 3

## Hire a new employee

⚙ Settings → AGENTS → **＋ Hire a new agent**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Name + Title | Shown on their name tag in the world and in chat |
| Avatar (12 faces) + Aura | Their look + the magic ring beneath their feet (pick an element) |
| 🏢 Org tier (tier 1-3) | Position in the org chart (🗂 → ORG) |
| Prompt + Persona v2 | Their identity: expertise / personality / language / working rules |
| Skills / Tools | Special abilities + the tools they're allowed |

## Roles are templates, agents are the runtime

The **ROLES** tab is now a template layer:

- `runtime` default for the role
- default tier
- default skills / tools
- persona seed for future hires

The **AGENTS** row is still the execution truth:

1. `agent.runtime` wins if it is set
2. otherwise the agent inherits `role.runtime`
3. otherwise it uses the office default runtime

If an agent is set to **Codex**, it uses the local Codex CLI config and does **not**
need a BagIdea CONNECT provider key. The Claude brain/provider controls stay for
Claude-style agents only.

Don't feel like writing a persona yourself? Type a short one-line brief and press
**✨ Draft** — the Persona Copilot drafts every field for you (prompt, expertise, personality,
language, working rules) **and picks the skills + tools that fit the role** (only from what
actually exists — managers get fewer tools, hands-on roles get more). You can edit it afterward

> Long agent list? Every tab has a 🔍 search box — type to filter instantly
> (sorted CEO first → Director → the rest in order). An office holds up to **18 people**
> (not counting the CEO) — below the list a counter shows **N / 18 agents**, how many you've hired.
> When it's full, the hire button disables (parallel work can use ghost-forking 👻 instead, unlimited)

## Tools and the Security Center

- **Tools you tick = permanently allowed** — the agent uses them silently, with no prompt card (there's a log in the feed)
  and **without walking away from the desk** (it briefly pauses to confirm it really needs to go ask first)
- Tools you *didn't* grant → the character walks into the Security Center and a request card pops up
  with the exact command it will run: **✓ Allow** (this time) / **✓✓ Always** (remember + add to the
  agent's tools) / **✗ Deny**
- No answer within 50 seconds = auto-deny (the agent re-plans on its own)
- You can act on it from feed mode too — the card has all the buttons built in

## Skills — the ability library

⚙ → SKILLS: every office ships with **10 base skill sets** (office-ops, deep-research,
office-control, plugin-builder, code-review, doc-writer, debug-detective,
data-wrangler, project-kickoff, diagram-maker) — assign them to anyone in the edit screen. You can also write
your own skills (e.g. "how to deploy the company website") and assign them to any agent —
they'll travel with every new session of that agent

**Auto-learn** (can be toggled on/off): after finishing a real task that used several tools, the system asks itself
whether the task could be distilled into a reusable skill — if so, a new skill is saved, assigned to the person who
did it, and announced 📚 in the office (you'll see gold light burst above their head)

## MCP Servers — unlimited new abilities

⚙ → TOOLS → MCP SERVERS: enter a name + run command, e.g.

| Name | Command |
|---|---|
| `github` | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` |
| `playwright` | `npx -y @playwright/mcp` (can drive a browser) |

then tick `mcp:github` in the agent's edit screen — that server's entire tool set
becomes available to the agent (through the permission system, like any normal tool)

## What agents do on their own, without being taught

- **Forking** (sub-agents): work that can run in parallel is split into 2-4 clones running at once (see 👻 below)
- **Read/write the central note board** (`workspace/notes.md`) to leave you messages
- **Know every registered project** — mention one by name in chat and they go work inside the real folder
- **Use the API keys** you stored in 🔗 CONNECT (auto-injected into the env)
- When idle, they watch TV, play football, hang out with the cat, or nap in the dorm 😴

## 👻 Forking (Ghost clones) — working in parallel

Agents in this office **fork as a matter of course** — if a task breaks into independent parts that can run at once,
they won't do them one at a time and waste your time. Instead they split into **2-4 translucent spirit clones**
working in parallel right away. Common cases: gathering news / researching multiple topics or sources, reviewing/fixing
multiple files, comparing several options, scraping multiple sites, testing multiple cases

**You can watch it happen for real** on screen: the translucent clones **float up a glass staircase to the "Ghost Deck"**
(a floating platform in the top-right), take their own desks, with status tags showing what they're doing, then when
they finish they **drift back and merge into their owner**. In the 🧵 thread menu, each clone has its own session
tagged 👻 that you can open and read

> You can let them fork on their own, or **tell them directly**, e.g.
> "Fork off to find news on A, B, C at the same time" — they'll split the subtasks as instructed

Once every clone reports back, the owner **merges everything into a single answer** for you — you get one consolidated
result distilled from all the parallel work, not a scattering of separate answers
(forking doesn't count against the 18-person quota — unlimited)

## 🗣 Team meetings/discussions (Discussions)

Want several agents to **debate a problem among themselves** instead of asking each one separately? Open a discussion

**Open one:** press **⋯** (the More menu in the header) → **🗣 Agent discussion**
to bring up the **AGENT DISCUSSION** window, then fill in 3 things:

| Field | What to enter |
|---|---|
| **TOPIC** | The topic for the team to debate, e.g. "Plan the new onboarding feature" |
| **PARTICIPANTS** | Tick **2-4 people** from the team (the CEO is you, and doesn't join the AI discussion) |
| **ROUNDS** | How many rounds to loop: **1 quick · 2 standard · 3 deep** |

then press **🗣 Start discussion** (you need a topic + at least 2 people selected)

**Watch them meet:** the selected people **walk over and gather in the meeting room**, then **speak one at a time,
round by round** — each builds on the previous person's view, with the conversation posted as whiteboard minutes
you can read live. If an idea that "should really be built" comes up during the talk, an agent may submit a **PROPOSAL**
for you to approve/reject. Multiple discussions can run at once (different teams)

**History:** every meeting is saved as a group session — open it in the 🧵 thread menu
under **"🗣 Meetings"** (read-only), and it's also saved as a Markdown file in
`workspace/meetings/` so other agents can grep it for reuse

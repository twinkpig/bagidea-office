# Common problems

## Installation problems

The installer is designed to "finish in one pass on a clean machine," but some
machines have different conditions. Below are all the common symptoms and how to
fix them — almost everything is solved by **opening a new terminal and re-running
the installer** (re-running is safe; no data is lost).

**`irm ... | iex` shows an execution policy error**
- Run this line instead:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagidea/bagidea-office/main/installer/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

**`winget not found`**
- Older Windows doesn't have winget yet — install **App Installer** from the Microsoft Store
  (`https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nns1`), then open a new terminal and re-run.

**Git/Node installed but `git`/`node` not found when it continues**
- winget writes PATH to the registry, but the existing terminal doesn't see it yet — the
  installer refreshes PATH for you within the same pass, but if it still happens,
  **close the terminal, open a new one, and re-run** and it will definitely be fixed.

**`BUILD FAILED` / `cargo build` shows `error: linker 'link.exe' not found` or `link.exe returned exit code`**
- This is the most common symptom: Rust needs Visual Studio's **C++ linker**.
- This version of the installer installs the **VS C++ Build Tools** automatically, but if that
  round was skipped/incomplete, install it yourself:
  ```powershell
  winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--quiet --wait --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
  ```
  Or open the **Visual Studio Installer** → Modify → check **Desktop development with C++** → Install
- When done, **open a new terminal** (so the build environment variables load) and re-run the installer.

**`cargo`/`rustup` not found right after installing Rust**
- Open a new terminal, or temporarily run: `$env:Path += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin"` then re-run.

**Godot download hangs/fails**
- A network/firewall issue while downloading the file from GitHub releases — check your
  connection and re-run (the installer skips steps that are already done and downloads only what's missing).

**SmartScreen / Defender blocks the script or app (Windows)**
- Everything is open source and readable in the repo. The installer scripts and the
  prebuilt shell are **unsigned for now**, so Windows may warn. Click **More info → Run
  anyway**, or download `install.ps1`, read it first, then run it yourself. (Code signing
  is on the roadmap — it'll remove the prompt.)

**macOS: "can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"**
- The prebuilt binary is unsigned for now. The installer already clears the download
  quarantine, but if Gatekeeper still blocks it: **right-click the app → Open** (then
  **Open** again in the dialog), or run
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/BagIdeaOffice/shell/target/release/bagidea-office-shell`.

**Build succeeds but typing `bagidea` isn't found**
- The command was just added to PATH — **open a new terminal** and try again
  (or open it from the Start Menu → "BagIdea Office").

**Want to start completely over**
- Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BagIdeaOffice` and re-run the installer (the data in there will be lost too —
  back up `app\daemon\*.json` first if you want to keep the registry/sessions).

## Linux (experimental 🧪)

**Shell won't compile (missing WebKitGTK, etc.)**
- The installer installs `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` (newer Ubuntu) or `4.0` (older) automatically —
  if it fails, install it yourself and re-run `./build-linux.sh`: `sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libsoup-3.0-dev build-essential pkg-config`

**`bagidea: command not found`**
- The installer creates a symlink at `~/.local/bin/bagidea` — open a new terminal, or
  `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

**The wallpaper doesn't attach to the background (it's a floating window)**
- Check that you're on X11: `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE` → if it says `x11` you need `wmctrl`/`xdotool`
  (`sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool`). If it says `wayland` = it uses a fullscreen bottom-most window fallback (by design).
- A transparent orb requires a running compositor (most desktop environments already have one).

**No sound (`bagidea say`)**
- Install a player: `sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils alsa-utils`

## Program / wallpaper

**Nothing happens when I open it / the wallpaper doesn't change**
- Opened it twice? The program is single-instance — the second one quietly exits.
  Check the tray icon first (it may already be running).
- Godot not found: set the `BAGIDEA_GODOT` env var to point at the Godot 4.6.x exe,
  then reopen (the installer sets this automatically).
- `bagidea status` tells you whether the daemon is up.

**Want to temporarily hide the office (meeting/screen recording)**
- Right-click the tray icon → **Hide office** — the wallpaper returns to normal, sound goes quiet,
  but agents keep working in the background — click again to bring it back.

**How to close the program completely**
- The only way is the tray icon → **Exit BagIdea Office** (or `bagidea stop`) —
  closes the whole suite + restores your original wallpaper.

## Agents

**An agent doesn't respond at all / task.failed immediately**
- Are you logged into Claude yet? Open a terminal and run `claude` once.
- Out of quota/credit has the same symptom — try `claude -p "hi"` to see the answer directly.

**A permission card pops up even though I checked the tools**
- Did you check them in the "edit agent" screen and save? Tools you grant = always silent.
- Tools you *didn't* check still ask as usual — click **✓✓ Always** to remember it permanently.

**I gave a command but it's silent, no activity visible**
- Look at the 🔵 NOW WORKING / 📡 feed bar — the task may be running.
- `bagidea feed` in the terminal also shows all live events.

## Projects

**Clicking ▶ shows "No conversation found to continue"**
- This is a limitation of `claude -c` with sessions created headless — the current version's ▶
  button uses `claude --resume <id>` directly now, so you shouldn't see it again
  (if you do = old version → `bagidea update`).

**Deleting a project (🗑) fails**
- A program is locking a file — the system closes a dev server the agent left running and
  retries automatically. If it still fails it shows an error in the row: close any terminal/Explorer
  stuck in that folder and click again.

**The window state (open/closed) is out of sync**
- The system sweeps every 5 seconds — wait a moment, or close and reopen the PROJECTS tab.

## Voice (Right Ctrl)

**Nothing happens when I press it**
- Have you turned on Windows Voice Typing? Settings → Time & language → Speech
  → online speech recognition + install the Thai language pack.
- Try pressing `Win+H` directly in any text field — if nothing appears, the OS feature isn't ready yet.
- Key conflict? Change the key in ⚙ → AGENTS → PUSH-TO-TALK HOTKEY.

**My speech goes into another program**
- The current version forces focus before opening the mic — if you still hit it, click the
  chat window once before pressing Right Ctrl, and feel free to file an issue.

## Channels

**Telegram shows error: bad token** — the token is wrong/expired; get a new one from @BotFather
**Discord stuck connecting** — you forgot to enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT on the Bot page
**LINE doesn't fire** — the webhook URL must be public HTTPS and end with
`/channels/line/webhook`; check that cloudflared is still running

## View raw logs

- All events: `daemon/journal.jsonl`
- Chat history: `daemon/sessions.json`
- Run the daemon yourself to watch the live console: stop the program first, then `node daemon\server.js`
